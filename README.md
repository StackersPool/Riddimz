# Riddimz
Riddimz is a decentralized karaoke app built on Stacks blockchain. It utilizes smart contracts and decentralized network of nodes to handle transactions, data storage and user interactions securely and transparently. Users can share and interact with karaoke-related content without relying on a central authority.

# About
Riddimz is a web3 karaoke project powered by Stacks using NFTs (non-fungible tokens) could offer a unique and innovative way for users to participate in and engage with karaoke online.

The project would leverage the blockchain technology of Stacks to create a decentralized platform for karaoke. Users would be able to purchase and own NFTs that represent a specific karaoke song, and then use them to participate in karaoke sessions on the platform.

The smart contract of the karaoke project could handle the transactions of the NFTs, as well as the distribution of royalties to the rights holders of the songs. This could provide a transparent and fair way for content creators to earn from their creations.

On the front-end, the karaoke platform could be built using a JavaScript framework such as React or Angular, with the use of web3.js to interact with the smart contract and display the NFTs to the users. Users could also have the ability to customize their karaoke performance,

The platform could also have a leaderboard feature that allows users to compete against each other, and earn rewards for their performances. Additionally, users could trade or sell their NFTs on the secondary market, potentially allowing them to earn a return on their investment.

Overall, a web3 karaoke project powered by Stacks using NFTs could offer a unique and engaging way for users to participate in karaoke online, while also providing a fair and transparent way for musicians to earn from their creations.

# GOALS 
Digital ownership and scarcity: NFTs allow users to own and trade unique digital assets, such as karaoke recordings, which can increase the perceived value of the content and foster a sense of community among users.

Monetization: NFTs enable creators and rights holders to monetize their digital assets, such as karaoke recordings, through sales and royalties.

Branding and marketing: NFTs can be used to create unique and memorable experiences for users, such as exclusive karaoke performances or limited-edition karaoke recordings, which can help to increase brand awareness and loyalty.

Authenticity and provenance: NFTs provide a way to verify the authenticity and provenance of digital assets, such as karaoke recordings, which can help to protect the rights of creators and rights holders.

Data collection: NFTs can be used to track data on user engagement, such as how often a karaoke recording is played or how much it sells for, which can be used to improve the user experience and inform business decisions.\
